## Overview

The **Cornell Digital Forestry Initiative (CoDiFI)** is a next-generation forestry research hub led by the BioM2 Lab. CoDiFI provides resources and expertise for integrating novel remote sensing technologies (e.g., drone, lidar) and computational techniques with conventional forestry measurements across a range of departments at Cornell University.

## Mission

CoDiFI aims to advance forestry research and practice by:

- **Bridging Technology and Traditional Forestry**: Combining cutting-edge remote sensing tools with established forestry methods
- **Building Research Capacity**: Providing training, resources, and expertise to researchers across Cornell and beyond
- **Fostering Collaboration**: Creating a hub for interdisciplinary collaboration across departments
- **Advancing Forest Monitoring**: Developing innovative approaches to measure and monitor forest ecosystems

## Key Technologies

CoDiFI focuses on integrating multiple remote sensing platforms and computational approaches:

- **Terrestrial Lidar Scanning (TLS)**: Tripod-based and backpack lidar systems for detailed 3D forest structure
- **Drone-based Remote Sensing**: RGB and multispectral imaging for landscape-scale monitoring
- **Computational Modeling**: Advanced algorithms for processing and analyzing multi-platform data
- **Machine Learning**: Extracting ecologically relevant information from complex datasets

## Training and Outreach

CoDiFI provides hands-on training opportunities for students, researchers, and forestry professionals. The inaugural summer training course in 2024 hosted a mix of PhD students, professional Master students, and foresters at Arnot Forest. The 4-day workshop introduced:

- Foundations of lidar remote sensing
- Procedures for applying tripod-based and backpack lidar systems
- Processes for conducting RGB drone flights
- Data processing and analysis techniques

## Research Impact

CoDiFI supports research across multiple scales and applications, from individual tree measurements to landscape-level forest monitoring. The initiative contributes to:

- Understanding forest carbon dynamics and storage
- Monitoring forest health and biodiversity
- Improving forest management practices
- Developing next-generation forest inventory methods
